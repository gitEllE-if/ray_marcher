# ðŸ”µ Raymarching Distance Fields

Ray marching algorithm, used in combination with a special kind of function called **SDF - signed distance functions**, can create cool things in real time.

There arenâ€™t using polygonal meshes and are instead using mathematical equations and the scene is drawn on a single quad that covers the cameraâ€™s field of vision

## ðŸŸ£ Signed distance functions

SDF is a function that takes in a point as input and returns the shortest distance from that point to the surface any object in the scene. SDF additionally returns a negative number if the input point is inside of an object.

So our SDF, for a sphere centered at the origin with radius 1, looks like this:
```
f(x,y,z) = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) - 1

f(1, 0, 0)   = 0      <- on the surface
f(0, 0, 0.5) = -0.5   <- inside
f(0, 3, 0)   = 2      <- outside
```
When weâ€™re working in GLSL shader code, formulas like this will be vectorized:
```
  _      _
f(p) = ||p|| - 1
```
Which, in GLSL, translates to this:
```
float sphere_SDF(vec3 p)
{
	return length(p) - 1.0;
}
```

## ðŸŸ¢ Run

```
git clone https://github.com/gitEllE-if/ray_marcher.git rayMarch

cd rayMarch

make

./RM
```
The program was tested and run on MacOS (Mojave, HighSierra, Catalina)
