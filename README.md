# ðŸ”µ Raymarching Distance Fields

Ray marching algorithm, used in combination with a special kind of function called **SDF - signed distance functions**, can create cool things in real time.

There arenâ€™t using polygonal meshes and are instead using mathematical equations and the scene is drawn on a single quad that covers the cameraâ€™s field of vision.

The C code is boilerplate to run the OpenGL. The raymarching magic occurs in **fragment shader** wich determine the screen pixel colours.

## ðŸŸ£ Signed distance functions

SDF is a function that takes in a point as input and returns the shortest distance from that point to the surface any object in the scene. SDF additionally returns a negative number if the input point is inside of an object.

So our SDF, for a sphere centered at the origin with radius 1, looks like this:
```
f(x,y,z) = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) - 1

f(1, 0, 0)   = 0      <- on the surface
f(0, 0, 0.5) = -0.5   <- inside
f(0, 3, 0)   = 2      <- outside
```
When weâ€™re working in GLSL shader code, formulas like this will be vectorized:
```
  _      _
f(p) = ||p|| - 1
```
Which, in GLSL, translates to this:
```
float sphere_SDF(vec3 p)
{
	return length(p) - 1.0;
}
```

## ðŸ”µ Raymarching

Raymarching is the alternative technique to Raytracing.
Instead of casting out a ray and attempting to intersect a line with an object, raymarching marches along a ray based on the scene's SDF until the distance output from the function is < 0.
We start at the camera, and move a point along the view ray, step by step. At each step, we check â€œDoes the SDF evaluate to a negative number at this point?â€œ. If it does, weâ€™re hit something, else we keep going up to some maximum number of steps along the ray.

The lighting model used is the [Blinn-Phong lighting model](https://habr.com/ru/post/353054/)

## ðŸŸ£ Shadertoy

Shadertoy is a tool that lets you experiment shaders without needing to write any OpenGL/WebGL boilerplate. You just write a fragment shader and watch how it work.
